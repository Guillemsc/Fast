tutorial1	Welcome to Upstream!	
tutorial1p1	During this tutorial you will learn the basics to play the game.	
tutorial1p2	In Upstream, you play as a group of salmons that wants to reach the top of the river.	
tutorial1p3	To begin with, let's learn learning how the salmon movement works.	
tutorial1p4	Drag and drop the token to the next tiles	
tutorial2	Well done!	
tutorial2p1	In a match, there are different types of map tiles.	
tutorial2p2	The ones that you were moving through are WATER tiles, and have no effects on the salmons.	
tutorial2p3	Then, there is the EAGLE tile.	
tutorial2p4	As you can see, when a token spawns, it starts with 2 salmons on it.	
tutorial2p5	EAGLE tiles eat 1 salmon when you swim to them, and then they get deactivated.	
tutorial2p6	Try it and see what happens!	
tutorial2p7	Move to the final WATER tile	
tutorial3	As you can see, your token only has 1 salmon left!	
tutorial3p1	If you lose all the salmons, your token disappears	
tutorial3p2	Move to the final WATER tile	
tutorial4	Now, all the salmons died and your token is gone!	
tutorial4p1	To avoid tiles that may eat your salmons, you can jump to fly over them.	
tutorial4p2	So now we have two types of movements, SWIM and JUMP. Let's try it!	
tutorial4p3	JUMP past the EAGLE tile	
tutorial4p4	Make sure you JUMP over the EAGLE tile	
tutorial5	Perfect!	
tutorial5p1	Now, let's see other type of tiles:	
tutorial5p2	The WATERFALL tile forces a salmon to JUMP if it wants to enter or leave through it's waterfall sides.	
tutorial5p3	This tile can appear in any rotation.	
tutorial5p4	The BEAR tile eats a salmon if you enter, leave, or go through it while jumping.	
tutorial5p5	Also, if you want to leave or enter the BEAR tile through the waterfall sides, you are forced to JUMP.	
tutorial5p6	Let's practice!	
tutorial5p7	Reach the final BEAR tile without loosing any salmons	
tutorial5p8	You need to avoid loosing salmons!	
tutorial5p9	Remember the BEAR tile eats a salmon if you enter, leave, or go through it while jumping!	
tutorial6	Well done!	
tutorial6p1	Now let's go thorugh the general rules of a normal game.	
tutorial6p2	A regular match can have from 2 to 4 players,	
tutorial6p3	in this case it's only 2 players, you and a CPU.	
tutorial6p4	Every player starts with 4 tokens with 2 salmons each.	
tutorial6p5	Also every player has 5 avaliable movements during its turn to move their tokens,	
tutorial6p6	except in games 2vs where the player that starts only has 4 movements the first turn.	
tutorial6p7	SWIMMING costs 1 movement per tile, and JUMPING costs 1 movement per tile plus 1.	
tutorial6p8	Also, the maximum ammount of tokens that can be on one tile are the same as the number of players on the game.	
tutorial6p9	For example in this game there can only be 2 tokens in the same tile.	
tutorial6p10	Except on the ROCK tile, where the number of tokens that can be placed,	
tutorial6p11	is equal to the number of players on the game, less 1.	
tutorial6p12	For example in this match there can only be 1 token in a ROCK tile.	
tutorial6p13	That's a lot of new things... Let's test them!	
tutorial6p14	As you can see, each player gets all their movement points back every new round.	
tutorial6p15	A game can have a varible number of rounds.	
tutorial6p16	And with that, it's time to indroduce another new tile, the HERON.	
tutorial6p17	The HERON tile eats one salmon only if at the end of a round, the salmon is over the HERON tile.	
tutorial6p18	If more than one tokens of the same player end up on the HERON at the end of a round,	
tutorial6p19	only one salmon of one token is eaten.	
tutorial6p20	Let's continue with the game...	
tutorial6p21	As you've seen, at the end of a round (except the first one), the river goes up.	
tutorial6p22	As the salmons go up, the ones that are left at the last tiles, die instantly at the end of the round.	
tutorial6p23	Well done, this is almost the end. Let's talk about our final tile.	
tutorial6p24	The EGGS TILE 4 tiles.	
tutorial6p25	These tiles appear when the round counter reaches to 0, and mark the start of the ending of the game.	
tutorial6p26	The objective of the salmons is to reach these tiles,	
tutorial6p27	as they need to arive as fast and as many as possible to win the largest ammount of points.	
tutorial6p28	For each remaining salmon (NOT salmon token), its owner scores 1 point.	
tutorial6p29	For each remaining salmon token, its owner scores as many points as eggs are in that tokenâ€™s space.	
tutorial6p30	The player with most points is the winner.	
tutorial6p31	Let's finish the game now!	
base_game_mode_expl_end	Game ends when all salmons are dead or at the end of the map	
base_game_mode_expl_points	For each remaining salmon: <br>+1 point <br><br>For each remaining salmon token: <br>+(eggs on token tile) points	
mode_expl_tiles	Tiles that can appear:
